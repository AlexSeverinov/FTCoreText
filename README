Welcome to FTCoreText Objective C library for iOS development.

Implemantation Instructions:

    Import CoreText.framework to your library
    Import FTCoreTextView.h
    Create an Instance of FTCoreTextView
    set the styles and the text for the view

Notes:

Use of the CoreText framework is granted only from iOS 4.0 for iPhone and 3.2 for iPad on.

Although FTCoreTextView uses an html-like tag syntax all the complex properties of html are not supported. Most of the time this will result as not formatted text but sometimes it can lead to crashes. For instance nested tags are not allowed. There is a self.path reference to draw the text along a specific shape instead the given frame. This feature has been only partially implemented and not tested.
